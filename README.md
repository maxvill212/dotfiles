*Work in progress*

Once you have a bare arch install, run the script to install a basic setup. Creates the Docments, Downloads and Pictures folder, installs zsh and sets it as the default shell, installs oh-my-zsh and yay, then a few programs to get you started (See list below). It then enables the display manager. After copying over the config files, it askes the user for a reboot. Make sure ly is set to sway.
